## USER GUIDE ##
# This module is a collection of compendiums ONLY. World Scripts will not be included. The current list of compendiums, and a description of each is provided below:

### CLASSES ###
# The classes compendium contains a list of main classes that all players are allowed to use. Each class in this compendium must draw all of its features from the
# Class Features compendium. Classes need to have a description that contains a short description of the class, a table detailing the features gained by members
# of the class, and a short description of each feature in the class.

### CLASS FEATURES ###
# The Class Features compendium contains all of the features that characters gain from their main class and their subclass. Features that are included in this
# compendium must have basic functionality in Foundry.

### SUBCLASSES ###
# The Subclasses compendium contains all of the subclasses allowed for the main classes in the Classes compendium. These subclasses get their features from the Class
# Features compendium. Subclasses should have a short description of each of the features they provide. Subclasses can be formatted using the ClassFormat.md but you
# can skip the class description and table.

### RACES ###
# The Races compendium contains all of the playable races that can be used. Races should have a short description of the race's physical appearance and identifying
# behavioral traits. All of the races in this compendium must take their traits from the Racial Features compendium.

### RACIAL FEATURES ###
# The Racial Features compendium contains all of the traits that are assigned to a character from their race. Features that are included in this compendium must
# have basic functionality in Foundry.

### INFORMATIONAL ENTRIES ###
# The Informational Entries compendium contains journal entry documents that provide extended information for classes and subclasses, races, and their features.
# Each document in this compendium should be linked in the description of the class, subclass, race, or feature that it describes.

## ADDING NEW MATERIAL ##
# If you intend to add new material to this module, please abide by the following guidelines:
# 1. Do not add material that the group has not agreed to use globally into any of the compendiums.
# 2. Do not create new compendiums for assets that can be placed in the existing compendiums (Do not make new Class compendiums or Class Feature compendiums).
# 3. Do not create new compendiums in the module without updating this file to include the new compendium and a description of it.
# 4. See the AppendAsset.md document for tips to include a new asset in a compendium.
