### COMPENDIUMS
#### CLASSES
The classes compendium contains a list of main classes that all players are allowed to use. Each class in this compendium must draw all of its features from the
Class Features compendium. Classes need to have a description that contains a short description of the class, a table detailing the features gained by members
of the class, and a short description of each feature in the class.

#### CLASS FEATURES
The Class Features compendium contains all of the features that characters gain from their main class and their subclass. Features that are included in this
compendium must have basic functionality in Foundry.

#### SUBCLASSES
The Subclasses compendium contains all of the subclasses allowed for the main classes in the Classes compendium. These subclasses get their features from the Class
Features compendium. Subclasses should have a short description of each of the features they provide. Subclasses can be formatted using the ClassFormat.md but you
can skip the class description and table.

#### RACES
The Races compendium contains all of the playable races that can be used. Races should have a short description of the race's physical appearance and identifying
behavioral traits. All of the races in this compendium must take their traits from the Racial Features compendium.

#### RACIAL FEATURES
The Racial Features compendium contains all of the traits that are assigned to a character from their race. Features that are included in this compendium must
have basic functionality in Foundry.

#### INFORMATIONAL ENTRIES
The Informational Entries compendium contains journal entry documents that provide extended information for classes, subclasses, races, and features.
Each document in this compendium should be linked in the description of the class, subclass, race, or feature that it describes.
