The item you infuse serves as the creature’s heart, around which the creature’s body instantly forms.</p>\n<p>You determine the homunculus’s appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>\n<p>The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>\n<p>In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<p>The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it.

The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ReplicateMagicItem\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Replicate Magic Item</h3>\n<p>Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a magic item that you can make with it, picking from the Replicable Items tables.

Alternatively, you can choose the magic item from among the common magic items in the game, not including potions or scrolls.</p>\n<p>In the tables, an item’s entry tells you whether the item requires attunement.
